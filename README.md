## Why "AC Dustbin"?

"AC" is short for "Allan Chain", my GitHub ID. It is not unique, but it's short :smile:

> What? Why "Allan Chain"? That's a long story but I am keeping it short here.

> Well, "Allan" is the English name I chose 7 years ago. This is a completely valid name while different from common "Alan". ~~Also, with name starting with "A", I have advantage when ordering by name alphabetically.~~
>
> However, "Chain" is a invented last name. It's pronounced like my family name. Besides, you will get the name of my homeland by reordering these five letters.

`"dustbin" == "dust" + "bin"` Every blog post, or thought, is just like a piece of dust, which is not a big deal to the whole world. But I try to keep all the dust organized in a bin, and maybe It will be helpful to someone.

## Why Issues?

I have already disscussed in [vue-iblog#why-use-github-issues](96). Besides, People will see my post if I mention other issues. ~~正所谓打广告于无形之中~~
