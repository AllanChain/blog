Should I introduce myself a little bit?

### Fast Intro

- Started from Python
- Know some JavaScript
- FFmpeg fan
- Vim fan
    - Sometimes VS Code
- Windows user
    - Tried Git Bash, MSYS2, VM, WSL
- Currently in School of Magicks, Peking University
    - From a much less known high school

### Getting Started with Python

Actually, I started learning python during the Qingming Festival in 2016, when I have been admitted into TG's Innovation Class (Alright, BAD translation). At that time, we students from Modern Experimental School do not have much freedom to do what we want and that's why Qingming Festival is a good time for making the decision to learn a new programing language.

I was planning to learn C++ or Java, which seemed more useful. But on seeing python's growth and its introduction (and definitely my father's recommendation), I gave it a shot.

Before learning python, I have studied pascal and Visual Basic for city's IT competition. I thought python is the *real* programing language and its power amazed me. So I kept on.

Getting started with python was rather easy. As is known to all, the best way to learn a programing language is to learn with a project. But as a relatively new guy, I did not have much to to except... GAMES! That's why the first third party package I got to know was `pygame`.

### What about Git?

After about one year and a half, I started using git & github partly because the terrible loss when developing 2048 and the countless `2048 (x).py`. 

Actually I have tried to learn git before, but when I installed git bash and typed `help`... Boom! WTH?!

To be honest, only myself was involved in all my git repos at first. It's not until I tried to manage all our scripts in `TGScripts` repo that we (txtyb, Jimmy Jiale, and I) first started contributing to the same project. However, there was not too much conflicts to resolve.

During the summer vacation in 2019, Jimmy Jiale and I worked on <https://tg2019303.github.io/> project, at the same time. That's what git should do, I think, and we also suffered from the conflicts and endless manual merge. This may be a project with the most strong influence, partly because it's presented in a form which everyone could understand and appreciate.

### Arriving at PKU
Well, that's difficult to say. Though I am not in the EESC of PKU, I coded a lot :joy:.

One thing is worth mentioning: discovering the security hole of PKU campus card system! That excited me a lot, and I made use of the BDWM BBS to "imporve my social fame a bit". For more information, You can have a look at [That Repo](https://github.com/AllanChain/PKUCard)

### PKUPHYNOC

Emmm, I don't know how to translate *北大物院学生会网络运营中心* to English...

Alright, that's a really big projesct and have taken most of my spare time (though I also played around many stuffs).

It was the first year of [PKUPHYNOC](https://github.com/pkuphysu) (previously *办公室*), and we want to make use of the wechat official account and a cloud server to bring new experience to the students.

I have kept a development log in that repo (for future reference), but due to security reasons, that repo is private. There were indeed many exciting things when building a whole new world.

### The JavaScript World

Just learning Python is not enough. By using JavaScript, I can almost deal with any platform: web of course, and desktop powered by electron, mobile dev powered by PWA... And Python for simple scripts, data processing and server...

As said before, I learned plain JS during high school. But it's not until the first college year did I start to learn Vue. At first, I tried to simplify <https://tg2019303.github.io/> project. And Vue is known for it's progress feature, so I adopt in.

Later, believe it or not, I chose Vue because it's more pythonic compared with react, and more stars! But Vue itself was not well-documented, at least for me, making it hard to progress.

...To be continued...
