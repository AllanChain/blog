Should I introduce myself a little bit?

### Getting started with python

Actually, I started learning python during the Qingming Festival in 2016, when I have been admitted into TG's `Innovation Class` (创新班). At that time, we students from Modern Experimental School do not have much freedom to do what we want and that's why Qingming Festival is a good time for making the decision to learn a new programing language.

I was planning to learn C++ or Java, which seemed more useful. But on seeing python's growth and its introduction (and definitely my father's recommendation), I gave it a shot.

Before learning python, I have studied pascal and Visual Basic for city's IT competition. I thought python is the *real* programing language and its power amazed me. So I kept on.

Getting started with python was rather easy. As is known to all, the best way to learn a programing language is to learn with a project. But as a ralatively new guy, I did not have much to to except... GAMES! That's why the first third party package I got to know was `pygame`.

### What about git?

After about one year and a half, I started using git & github partly because the terrible loss when developing 2048 and the countless `2048 (x).py`. 

Actually I have tried to learn git before, but when I installed git bash and typed `help`... Boom! WTH?!

To be honest, only myself was involved in all my git repos at first. It's not until I tried to manage all our scripts in `TGScripts` repo that we (txtyb, Jimmy Jiale, and I) first started contributing to the same project. However, we did the work synchronously.

During the summer vacation in 2019, Jimmy Jiale and I worked on <https://tg2019303.github.io/> project, asynchonously. That's what git should do, I think, and we also sufferred from the conflicts and endless manual merge. This may be a project with the most strong influence, partly because it's presented in a form which everyone could understand and appreciate.

### Arriving at PKU
Well, that's difficult to say. Though I am not in the EESC of PKU, I coded a lot :joy:.

One thing is worth mentioning: discovering the security hole of PKU campus card system! That excited me a lot, and I made use of the BDWM BBS to "imporve my social fame a bit". For more information, You can have a look at [That Repo](https://github.com/AllanChain/PKUCard)

### PKUPHYNOC

Emmm, I don't know how to translate *北大物院学生会网络运营中心* to English...

Alright, that's a really big projesct and have taken most of my spare time (though I also played around many stuffs).

It was the first year of [PKUPHYNOC](https://github.com/pkuphysu) (previously *办公室*), and we want to make use of the wechat official account and a cloud server to bring new experience to the students.

I have kept a development log in that repo (for future reference), but due to security reasons, that repo is private. There were indeed many exciting things when building a whole new world.

...To be continued...
