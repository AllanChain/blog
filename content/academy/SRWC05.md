### Anna从哪几方面替姐姐分析？
- 个人的爱情回报
>  pine away all your youth long, and know not sweet children or love’s rewards? 

- 对国家的战略
> What a city you will see rise here, my sister, what a realm, by reason of such a marriage! With Teucrian arms beside us, to what heights will Punic glory soar? 

- 对神
> Only ask favour of the gods and, with sacrifice duly offered,

- Already died

> Do you think that dust or buried shades give heed to that?



> With these words she fanned into flame the queen’s love-enkindled heart

### Why do you think Virgil chose to give us this glimpse into his hero's heart?

### Do you think knowing how Aeneas acted against his own feelings makes him a greater or a lesser hero?

This showed another dimension of Aeneas, making him a richer man inside rather than a stereotype 

 one. Showing his heart makes him more a hero than a symbol.

> ​	Dido's perspective: "viewing from the top of the fortress"

> **It was night, and over the earth weary creatures were tasting the peace of slumber; the woods and wild seas had sunk to rest – the hour when stars roll midway in their gliding course, when all the land is still, and beasts and coloured birds, both those that far and near haut the limpid lakes, and those that dwell in the thorny thickets of the countryside, are couched in sleep beneath the silent night.**
