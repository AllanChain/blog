 I. Mark what you find difficult or doubtful in the text, and be ready to discuss them in class. 

 II. Think over the following questions while reading. These are also suggested topics for the presenters of next week. Presenters may choose any one or a few of these topics, or just use your own topics. 除了下周做报告的同学，也欢迎所有同学在教学网讨论版就以下及更多问题发表自己的看法。

 \1. What is the historical background for the trial of Socrates? What crimes was Socrates accused of?

 Who made accusations against Socrates?  What kind of people were they?  For what reasons did they make these charges against Socrates, according to themselves? and according to Socrates?

 \2. Try to figure out the logic of Socrates’ self-defense. For what purpose did Socrates start with trying to find out the wisest man? What were the major things that Socrates said on the court? What do you think is the purpose of Socrates' apology? Would you consider his self-defense a successful one or not? and why? 

 \3. Socrates asked three men in order to find a wiser man. What might be the reasons for his choosing them? Were these three men good choice? Why or why not?

 \4. What was the image of Socrates in "The Clouds" by Aristophanes? Why did Aristophanes depict Socrates so?

 再补充几个宽泛一些但仍与The Apology相关的话题：

 （欢迎做报告的同学考虑，也欢迎这周不做报告但有兴趣的同学在课堂上就此发言，或在平台讨论版发帖）

 \5. What is an oracle? How important was it to Athenians? What did the Athenians mean by impiety?

 \6. What is the political background for the Apology?

 \7. Plato's “The Dialogues” 柏拉图的对话录

 \8. The Criminal Proceedings in Athens and the trial of Socrates 雅典的诉讼程序与苏格拉底审判

 本周文件夹中还有几种参考书和视频供大家选读选看。

## The Trial of Socrates

- What crimes was Socrates accused of?

    > *asebeia* (impiety) against the [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(religion))(万神殿) of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: "failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges" and "introducing new deities(神，神灵)".

- What is the historical background for the trial of Socrates?

    > Before the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Athens) knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society.
    >
    >  In the comic play, *The Clouds* (423 BC), [Aristophanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes) represents Socrates as a [sophistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophism) philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father.
