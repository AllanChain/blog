## Text

> reverend Fathers

The audiance

> Abdala the Saracen

也不知道是谁

> Hermes Trismegistus

三尊赫尔墨斯，万岁万岁万万岁

tris - three

megistus - your majesty

> that man is the **intermediary between creatures**, *the intimate of the god*s, ***the king of the lower beings***, 
>
> **by the acuteness of his senses**, *by the discernment of his reason*, and ***by the light of his intelligence***
>
> **the interpreter of nature**, *the interval between fixed eternity and fleeting time*, and (as the Persians say), the ***bond, nay, rather, the marriage song of the world***,
>
> on David's testimony but little lower than the angels.
>
> ---
>
> **to ponder the plan of so great a work**, *to love its beauty*, ***and to wonder at its vastness***
>
> ---
>
> But there was **not among His archetypes that from which He could fashion a new offspring**, *nor was there in His treasure houses anything which He might bestow on His new son as an inheritance*, ***nor was there in the seats of all the world a place where the latter might sit to contemplate the universe.***
>
> 无形，无能，无位

终于引用圣经：Psalm, written by David

> they are not the principal grounds

> those which may rightfully claim for themselves the privilege of the highest admiration

（根本的理由）理直气壮地说为什么担得起最高的赞赏

> the blessed choirs of heaven

九级天使

> the universal chain of Being

宇宙巨链  Plato Aristotle 等级结构

Ladder of intellect

God

- angels
- demons
- star moon
- king noble princes
- man
- wild animals
- domestic animals
- trees plant
- stone metal minerals

> lot

Place assigned is called `lot`

> to ponder the plan of so great a work, to love its beauty, and to wonder at its vastness

Secretly put something new in it. 

- Emotion of God 
- The purpose for God's creation

New meaning? God inability? THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS

> as Moses and Timaeus bear witness

The Bible and Plato are equal

> that he who was to praise God's divine generosity in regard to others should be compelled to condemn it in regard to himself.

应该看到其他动物，赞扬神。看到自己，抱怨神。

> proper:   property, proper noun 专有的s



> He therefore took man as a creature of indeterminate nature

未定特性 &rarr; 无能

> He therefore took man as a creature of indeterminate nature

中央 &rarr; 无位

> constrained by no limits, in accordance with thine **own free will**



> he withdraws into the center of his own unity, his spirit, made one with God, in the solitary darkness of God, who is set above all things, shall surpass them all.
