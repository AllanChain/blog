### The Papal Power

檄文

the temporal power is lower than the spiritual power

> Even when **they** (church) have been compelled to hold a council they have weakened **its** (council) power in advance by putting the princes under oath to let **them** (Romanists) remain as they were.

发誓不动利益

> This is just their own ruling, and is only valid as long as it is not harmful to Christendom or contrary to the laws of God.

Bring a new criteria

反贪官不反皇帝

> Therefore, when necessity demands it, and the pope is an offense to Christendom, the first man who is able / should, **as a true member of the whole body**, do what he can to bring about a truly free council.

作为真正基督教世界的一份子，指有能力就身先士卒站出来。

> fellow-Christians, fellow-priests, fellow-members of the spiritual estate, fellow-lords over all things.

人人皆是 priest (person who preaches God)

同为属灵阶级：只要信上帝

lords of all things: Genesis

Quoting from Bible

> righteousness does not consists in works, although works neither can nor ought to be **wanting**

缺乏

> My kingship is not **of** this world

&dArr; 属于和在的区别

> My kingship is not here, that is, **in** this world.
