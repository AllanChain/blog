2. If you are to prove or disprove God's existence, what  might your arguments be like?

4. Does any of Aquinas' arguments convince you or raise doubts in your mind? Why?

5. Thomas in his discussion made use of Aristotle's theory of Four Causes. Briefly explain that theory.

Faith <---> Reason

St. Au      Aristotle

Reasoning + Faith --> Truth

### Pre 1

Newton's motion 

### Pre 2 & 3

Aristotle create the `cause`

- Material Cause
    - marble

- Formal Cause
    - David

- Agent / Efficient cause
    - Michelangelo
    - transform : potentiality to actuality
- Final cause
    - For ...

Agent Cause & Infinite regress does not exist

Potentiality: is to be

Actuality: has been

Motion: all changes

**Whether god exists: The origin of world**

Does God needs a origin?

Counter Arguements

- No need for God
- origin of lord

> for nothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to **that** towards which it is in motion
>
> that: see it as noun

> If **that** by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that by another again.
