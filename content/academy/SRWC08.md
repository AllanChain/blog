Faith <---> Reason

St. Au      Aristotle

Reasoning + Faith --> Truth

### Pre 1

Newton's motion 

### Pre 2 & 3

Aristotle create the `cause`

- Material Cause
    - marble

- Formal Cause
    - David

- Agent / Efficient cause
    - Michelangelo
    - transform : potentiality to actuality
- Final cause
    - For ...

Agent Cause & Infinite regress does not exist

Potentiality: is to be

Actuality: has been

Motion: all changes

**Whether god exists: The origin of world**

Does God needs a origin?

Counter Arguements

- No need for God
- origin of lord

> for nothing can be in motion except it is in potentiality to **that** towards which it is in motion
>
> that: see it as noun

> If **that** by which it is put in motion be itself put in motion, then this also must needs be put in motion by another, and that by another again.
