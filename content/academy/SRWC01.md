### Athens' attitude towards its allies

> When the Spartans invade our land, they do not come by themselves, but bring all their allies  with them; whereas  we, when we launch  an attack abroad, do the job by ourselves ...

Though Pericles might be stressing the power of Athens' army by saying that they launch an attack by themselves, I think it also suggested that Athens got on badly with its allies.

> The **Delian League**, founded in 478 BC,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League#cite_note-1) was an association of [Greek city-states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis), with the number of members numbering between 150 and 330[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League#cite_note-3)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delian_League#cite_note-4) under the leadership of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Athens), whose purpose was to continue fighting the [Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire) after the Greek victory in the [Battle of Plataea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plataea) at the end of the [Second Persian invasion of Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece).

By 431 BC, Athens's heavy-handed control of the Delian League prompted the outbreak of the [Peloponnesian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War)

> The Thirty Years' Peace was first tested in 440 BC, when Athens's powerful ally [Samos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samos) [rebelled from its alliance with Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samian_War). 



Treating its allies in this way seems unreasonable.

Was that because Athens was too proud of itself that it looked down upon other states?
