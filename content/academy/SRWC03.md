To make things clear, I feel it necessary to state that there are 4 possible perspectives towards **fate**:

1. There is no fate at all
1. Fate exists, but we can change it by our effort (了凡)
1. We cannot change our fate, but we have the power to make some decisions (Sophocles)
1. Men are just puppets, everything is controlled by fate

In this text, discussing whether there is fate or not is useless. If everything is controlled by fate, the punishment or justice makes no sense. Thus, we should think both in angle 2 and 3.



And here is my opinion / answer:

- Do you think Oedipus has been fairly treated or wronged? Should he somehow be responsible for his fate? 
    - It's not fair.
    - If no one can escape the fate
        - It was the fate that let he kill his own father and brought the city into disaster because of the murder. To punish a man and whole city because of the arrangement of the fate?
        - No, as above.
    - If man can change the fate
        - He was punished for his murder, but not rewarded for his effort to avoid his tragedy, and not compensated for the abandonment of biological parents. And the punishment was too serious. He himself suffered mentally, the city suffered...
        - Yes, Because it was his fault to became angry and kill the old man
- Could Oedipus possibly have altered his fate? Why or why not?  
- Reflect on your answers to the above questions, and try to tell on what principles you have made such judgement? 
- What do you think is the purpose of Sophocles' writing this play? And what effect do you think this play would have for the ancient Athenians? Why do you think so?
    - To emphasize that fate can not be changed by men and steady the authority of gods and oracles.
- Is Oedipus a man of free will, or a puppet controlled by fate?  
    - Sophocles didn't deny the free will of men to some degree, because Oedipus can still strive for a change. But Sophocles still think that fate is unchangeable.
- What is fate?  Compare "fate" in this play and fate in the Chinese context. 
- A brief introduction to drama in the Ancient Greece.  
- A brief introduction to Sophocles and his other plays.
