## 预习提示
这也许是我们中大多数人第一次阅读神学家的文章。细心体会，与我们平时读的非神学家的论述文有什么相同与不同？
0. 请阅读课文，以及wikipedia上与St. Augustine及其The City of God相关的条目。
1. 本文是奥古斯丁的巨著《上帝之城》的节选，来自原书的第十四卷，散落其中。
2. 提供中译本供大家参考。
3. 请思考下列问题，这些问题同时也是给做报告同学的建议话题，也鼓励大家在讨论版交流想法。

    1. What is the background of Augustine's writing this book? For what purpose did he write it? After reading this text, do you think he could fulfill his purpose or not, and why? Which part of the text, in any, affects you?
    2. What sort of questions are dealt with in this book?
    3. What is the City of God and what is the City of Man?
    4. What criteria did Augustine use to make the differentiation between these two cities?
    5. Why did Augustine make this differentiation?
    6. Have you been convinced by Augustine's argument on sin? Why or why not?
    7. In what sense do you think the idea of sin and/or the origin of sin is important?
    8. Major events in Augustine's life, his conversion, and his position in Christian theology.
    9. From your life experience, your acquaintances with people, your reading and so on, what do you think are the necessary conditions for conversion皈依 to happen to anybody?
