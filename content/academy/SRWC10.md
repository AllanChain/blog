## The text

Life is a journey, not only a physical journey, but also a seek for God

> halfway upon our life

we all on this road, share the journey

> And as the man who with panting breath having issued forth from the deep upon the shore turns him round to the perilous water and gazes, so my mind, which still was fleeing, turned back to look at the pass which never yet let a person go alive.

经典比喻

>  the halted foot was ever the lower

上山

>  the hour of the clock and the sweet season were an occasion to me

春天的美好期望，不至于被吃掉

> made much people to live wretched

eaten many people

### The Guide

> at the time of the false and lying gods

The guide of the story is **not a Christian**

> Thou art my master and my authority

Dante was very proud of being a poet

> Thee it behoves to keep another road

There is no way for human to get the happiness directly

> wise == way: clockwise otherwise likewise

> Many are the animals with which she pairs; and more will be yet

娶贪婪为妻，犯下贪婪的罪过

> cause of his victory, and of the papal robe

Dante added "Papal robe"

> those who are in suspense

The Limbo

Beatrice: the blessed one
