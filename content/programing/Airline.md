vim airline is a tool to enhance the looking of vim. And it is a little tricky to setup especially in termux.

As I did not install any package manager for vim 
(in fact, I failed to install and setup Vundle), 
I need to clone the repo to `~/.vim/pack/dist/start/` to let vim automatically load the package. 
And I see the airline when I opened vim.

> By the way, all packages I tested (NERDTree, indentLine, gitgutter) all support this kind of operation.

## Trouble Shooting
#### Only mode and filename is displayed!

For termux disable the auto truncate of section A,B,C and Z is perfect. That is, let other sections truncate at a larger width than your screen.
```vim
let g:airline#extensions#default#section_truncate_width = {
    \ 'warning': 80,
    \ 'error': 80,
    \ 'x': 80,
    \ 'y': 80}
```
> Note: Only when nocompatible set can you use `\` to continue line.

#### No fancy `>` s there!
Enable fancy fonts!
```vim
let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1
```

#### There are dots following the mode!
Set the name of the modes!
```vim
let g:airline_mode_map = {
    \ 'c': 'C',
    \ 'n': 'N',
    \ 'V': 'V',
    \ 'i':'I'}
```

#### I do not need the section Z so long!
Set the custom section z!
```vim
let g:airline_section_z = '%2l/%Lâ˜°%2v'
```

#### What if I need a tab bar?
Enable it and set the good style!
```vim
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled=1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#formatter = 'unique_tail'
```

#### The word count is annoying!
Disable it!
```vim
let g:airline#extensions#wordcount#enabled = 0
```

#### Fancy style?
Yes Badwolf!
```vim
let g:airline_theme = 'badwolf'
```

#### Do not want extra `>` s?
Disable it!
```vim
let g:airline_skip_empty_sections = 1
```
