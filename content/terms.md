Copyright stuff is indeed very complicated and I don't know whether I have done right.
If you feel that I have infringed your copyright, please let me know and I will delete the content immediately.

I do have included some images found on Bing by link it to the original page,
and you can see that site URL when you hover the mouse over the image (only available on the blog post detail page).
But I am not sure whether it is okay to to so. Is the use of images here fair use?

As for blogs I wrote and images or screenshots I made, they are licensed under
`Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)`,
as you can see at the bottom of the page.

And indeed, some of the blogs are collective works, but there are still some of my personal understandings.
I think I have my part of copyright.

When it comes to the notes, which was under heated discussion before, is also very complicated.
My purpose for posting notes here is to manage my notes along with my programing blog posts, and for fluent mobile view.
And if fortunate enough, they can help other students in PKU.
I think posting notes here is not publishing, for my blog will never be that popular.
What's more, anyone who didn't take that course, can hardly understand my notes.
If my blog should be put under similar discussion, I will be happy to remove them :)
