Copyright stuff is indeed very complicated and I don't know whether I have done right. If you feel that I have infringed your copyright, please let me know and I will delete the content immediately.

I do have included some images found on Bing by link it to the original page, an you can see that site URL when you hover the mouse over the image (only available on the blog post detail page). But I am not sure whether it is okay to to so. Is the use of images here fair use?

As for blogs I wrote notes I took, and images or screenshots I made, they are licensed under `Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)`, as you can see at the bottom of the page.
