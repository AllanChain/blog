<p>Should I introduce myself a little bit?</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-python">Getting started with python</h3>

<p>Actually, I started learning python during the Qingming Festival in 2016, when I have been admitted into TG&rsquo;s <code>Innovation Class</code> (创新班). At that time, we students from Modern Experimental School do not have much freedom to do what we want and that&rsquo;s why Qingming Festival is a good time for making the decision to learn a new programing language.</p>

<p>I was planning to learn C++ or Java, which seemed more useful. But on seeing python&rsquo;s growth and its introduction (and definitely my father&rsquo;s recommendation), I gave it a shot.</p>

<p>Before learning python, I have studied pascal and Visual Basic for city&rsquo;s IT competition. I thought python is the <em>real</em> programing language and its power amazed me. So I kept on.</p>

<p>Getting started with python was rather easy. As is known to all, the best way to learn a programing language is to learn with a project. But as a ralatively new guy, I did not have much to to except&hellip; GAMES! That&rsquo;s why the first third party package I got to know was <code>pygame</code>.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-git">What about git?</h3>

<p>After about one year and a half, I started using git &amp; github partly because the terrible loss when developing 2048 and the countless <code>2048 (x).py</code>.</p>

<p>Actually I have tried to learn git before, but when I installed git bash and typed <code>help</code>&hellip; Boom! WTH?!</p>

<p>To be honest, only myself was involved in all my git repos at first. It&rsquo;s not until I tried to manage all our scripts in <code>TGScripts</code> repo that we (txtyb, Jimmy Jiale, and I) first started contributing to the same project. However, we did the work synchronously.</p>

<p>During the summer vacation in 2019, Jimmy Jiale and I worked on <a href="https://tg2019303.github.io/">https://tg2019303.github.io/</a> project, asynchonously. That&rsquo;s what git should do, I think, and we also sufferred from the conflicts and endless manual merge. This may be a project with the most strong influence, partly because it&rsquo;s presented in a form which everyone could understand and appreciate.</p>

<p>&hellip;To be continued&hellip;</p>
